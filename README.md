# pfSense-Initial-Setup
This repository provides the initial setup instructions for pfSense after installation. It covers prerequisites and steps to access the pfSense UI for the first time.

---

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites before proceeding with the setup:

1. **pfSense Server**  
   - pfSense should already be installed on a physical or virtual machine.
   - The pfSense server should have at least two network interfaces: one for the WAN and one for the LAN.

2. **LAN Connection**  
   - A host device (computer, laptop, etc.) connected to the LAN side of the pfSense server.
   - This device will be used to access the pfSense UI.

3. **IP Address Configuration**  
   - By default, pfSense assigns the LAN interface IP as **192.168.1.1**. Ensure your host device is on the same subnet (e.g., `192.168.1.x`).

4. **Web Browser**  
   - Any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) installed on the host device to access the web-based UI.

## Steps to Access the pfSense UI

1. **Connect to the LAN Network**  
   Ensure your host device is connected to the same LAN network as the pfSense server.

2. **Open a Web Browser**  
   Open a browser on the host device and type the following address in the URL bar:
   ```plaintext
   https://192.168.1.1
   ```
   - Note: If the LAN IP was changed during installation, use that IP instead.

3. **Bypass Security Warning (if any)**  
   - Since pfSense uses a self-signed certificate, your browser may display a security warning.
   - Select **Advanced** and proceed to the pfSense interface.

4. **Log in to the pfSense Dashboard**  
   - The default credentials are:
     - **Username**: `admin`
     - **Password**: `pfsense`
   - **Important**: Change the default password after logging in.

5. **Complete the Initial Setup Wizard**  
   - Upon first login, pfSense may guide you through an initial setup wizard.
   - Follow the prompts to configure basic settings such as timezone, hostname, and LAN/WAN interface settings.

## Additional Configuration (Optional)

After completing the initial setup, consider configuring additional pfSense features, such as:

- **Firewall Rules**: Set rules to allow or block traffic as per your network requirements.
- **DHCP Server**: Configure DHCP for dynamic IP allocation to devices on your LAN.
- **DNS and VPN**: Set up DNS or VPN services if needed.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Cannot Access UI**: 
  - Verify the host device‚Äôs IP address is in the same subnet as the pfSense LAN interface.
  - Check network cables or VM network settings if using a virtualized setup.

- **Forgot Password**: If you forgot the pfSense admin password, access the pfSense server console and use the option to reset the password.
